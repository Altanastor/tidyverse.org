title: Tidyverse packages

## Installation

The easiest way to install packages in the tidyverse is to run `install.packages()` tidyverse. This will install all packages listed below. 

To use them in an R session, you'll still need to load them. Use `library(tidyverse)` to load the core tidyverse (as described below).

## Core tidyverse

The core tidyverse loads the packages that you're likely to use in the majority of data analyses. As of tidyverse 1.1.0, the following packages are included in the code tidyverse:

<ul>
<li>
  <a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org"><img src="/images/hex-ggplot2.png" width="120" height="139" />
  </a>
  ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.
</li>

<li>
  <a href="http://tidyr.tidyverse.org"><img src="/images/hex-tidyr.png" width="120" height="139" />
  </a>
  tidyr provides a set of functions that help you get to tidy data. Tidy data is data with a consistent form: in brief, every variable goes in a column, and every column is a variable.
</li>

<li>
  <a href="http://readr.tidyverse.org"><img src="/images/hex-readr.png" width="120" height="139" />
  </a>
  readr provides a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf). It is designed to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes. 
</li>

<li>
  <a href="http://purrr.tidyverse.org"><img src="/images/hex-purrr.png" width="120" height="139" />
  </a>
  purrr enhances R’s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors. Once you master the basic concepts, purrr allows you to replace many for loops with code that is easier to write and more expressive.
</li>

<li>
  <a href="http://tibble.tidyverse.org"><img src="/images/hex-tibble.png" width="120" height="139" />
  </a>
  tibble is a modern re-imaginging of the data frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less (i.e. they don’t change variable names or types, and don’t do partial matching) and complain more (e.g. when a variable does not exist). This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code. 
</li>

</ul>
