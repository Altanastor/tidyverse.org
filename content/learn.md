title: Learn the tidyverse
---

## R for data science

The best place to start learning the tidyverse is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) (R4DS for short), an O'Reilly book written by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. It's designed to take you from knowing nothing about R or the tidyverse to having all the basic tools of data science at your fingertips.

You can read it online for free, or [buy a physical copy](http://amzn.to/2aHLAQ1).

We highly recommed pairing R4DS with the [RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). These cheatsheets have been carefully designed to pack a lot of information into a small amount of space so you can keep them handy at your desk and quickly jog your memory when you get stuck.
