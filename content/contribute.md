title: Contribute to the tidyverse

No matter your current skills, it's possible to contribute back to the tidyverse community. 

## Answer questions {#answers}

Everyone can help others who are newer to the tidyverse to them. Proactively follow the tidyverse tags on Twitter and Stack Overflow, and help out! Even if you don't know the answer, just helping someone prepare a better reprex can be tremendously useful. Just remember that while you might have seen the problem a hundred times before, it's new to the person asking it. Be patient, polite, and empathetic.

## File issues {#issues}

If you've found a bug, a minimal reprex that exercises it is a really great way to help out. Helping others make good reprexes is also a great skill.

To be as efficient as possible, development of tidyverse packages tends to be very bursty. Nothing happens for a long time, until a sufficient quantity of issues accumulates. Then there's a burst of intense activity as we focus our efforts. That makes development more efficient because it avoids expensive context switching between problems. This process makes a good reprex particularly important because it might be multiple months before your initial report and when we start working on it. If you can't reproduce the bug, we can't fix it!

## Contribute documentation 

If you're a bit more experienced with the tidyverse and are looking to improve your open source development skills, the next step up is to contribute a pull request to a tidyverse package.

You don't need to be an expert programmer to contribute: there are many other places that a fresh set of eyes can be tremendously helpful. Documentation often benefits from close proof reading, and more examples are almost always helpful. Vignettes and READMEs are other places where you can contribute if you're not yet a confident coder.

## Contribute code

If you are a more experienced programmer, you might want to help out with the development of the packages. Before you do a pull request, you should always file an issue and make sure someone from the tidyverse team agrees that it's a problem, and your basic proposal for fixing it. We don't want you to  

If you do contribute code, make sure to read the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/) which will make sure that your new code and documentation matches the existing style. This makes the review process much smoother.
