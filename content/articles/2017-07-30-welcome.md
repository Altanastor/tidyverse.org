Welcome to the new and improved tidyverse website. As well as a radically improve visual style, the site includes four main components:

<!--more-->

* [/packages](Packages): a listing of all packages in the tidyverse, 
  broken down by domain.
  
* [/learn](Learn): our advice on learning the tidyverse.

* [/help](Help): are you stuck on something involving the tidyverse?
  Learn how to write [a reprex](/help#reprex) then see our advice on
  where to ask for help.

* This blog! Expect to see regular updates on what's happening in the 
  tidyverse. This includes package updates, in person events, and
  integrative case studies that show you how to use multiple packages
  from the tidyverse to solve real problems.
  
The site is made with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown) and the source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyweb).
